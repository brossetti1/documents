Hello Chris,

I'm Daniel Baumann, software developer at SummitCove. I'm excited by the possibilities opened up by our integration with RazorCloud.

Peter has explained your need to create reservations in our system. This isn't something we've permitted in the past, but I'll be happy to work with you to make it happen. In the future we look forward to supporting the OpenTravel schema, but for now we're going to keep it simple. Here's what I have in mind:

1. Adding a new reservation (https)

Sample request (we'll send you valid auth credentials once the service is ready):

POST /xml/service/reservations HTTP/1.1
Host: www.summitcove.com
Content-Type: application/xml
Content-Length: length
Authenticate: Basic cmF6b3JjbG91ZDpwYXNzd29yZA==

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Reservation>
        <PropertyID>5</PropertyID>
        <FirstName>John</FirstName>
        <LastName>Doe</LastName>
        <Address>123 First St.</Address>
        <City>Springfield</City>
        <State>IL</State>
        <Zip>12345</Zip>
        <Country>US</Country>
        <DayPhone>123-456-7890</DayPhone>
        <EveningPhone>9876543210</EveningPhone>
        <Email>johndoe@gmail.com</Email>
        <Adults>1</Adults>
        <Children>2</Children>
        <InsuranceOptIn>1<InsuranceOptIn>
</Reservation>

Our responses:

200 Ok - reservation has been created
400 Bad Request - reservation could not be created (night minimum not met or property not available)
500 Internal Server Error - please send me an email

Let me know if you need any other information in the body of the response, such as the new reservation id.



2. Retrieving property information (there are some extra fields in here that aren't in /xml/properties.php).

Your request:

GET /xml/service/properties HTTP/1.1
Host: www.summitcove.com
Accept: application/xml
Authenticate: Basic cmF6b3JjbG91ZDpwYXNzd29yZA==

Sample response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml
Content-Length: length
