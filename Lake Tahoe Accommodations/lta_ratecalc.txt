Each property has six standard daily rates, in a 6-tier rate table.
Each rate can be set individually for each unit, but generally rates
#1, #2, #4, #5 and #6 are calculated automatically based on #3.

Daily Rates:
#1 is 80% of standard
#2 is same as standard, except for selected properties
#3 standard daily rate (used as base of calculation-not rate guest pays)
#4 is 120% of standard
#5 is 150% of standard
#6 is 200% of standard (generally Xmas, New Years)

There is a rate table calendar which dictates which rate is in effect
for each day of the year, along with the minimum allowed stay (in days)
for that unit. The highest rate in effect for any day of a guest's stay
determines which rate will be used for the rate calculation. Abnormal
situations are expected to be resolved by the reservationist (one day in
high season for a long reservation that would otherwise be at the
standard rate, for example).

The basic rental rate is simply the number of days times the daily rate,
there is no automatic discount for a seven-day reservation.

One hundred and fifty percent of the cleaning fee is added to the total
rent.

There is a 10% reservation service charge calculated on the total of
the rental amount and the cleaning fee.           

There is a $30 booking fee added to the rent, which is not refundable
unless the reservation is canceled soon after being booked (7 days?).

Occupancy tax is calculated on the total of the rental fee, cleaning fee,
and the booking fee.

There is a trip cancelation insurance fee of 6.5% which is not taxable
which is calculated on the total of rent, cleaning fee, reservation
service charge and tax.

TOTALDUE= ((((DAILYRATE X NRDAYS + (CLEANAMT X 1.5)) X 1.1) + BOOKFEE) X
          1.TAXRATE-DECIMAL) X 1.065

There are some special rules about advance deposits (deposits necessary
to confirm a reservation).
