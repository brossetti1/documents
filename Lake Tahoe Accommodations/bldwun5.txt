Standard file name: wdunit.lst

File is in comma-delimited, ASCII format, and all fields are enclosed in
double-quotes as text.

All quoted fields are separated by commas only.

No field contains the double-quote character, any double-quotes in text
   fields have been replaced with single quotes. 

Each record consists of a single line of ASCII characters, terminated
  with a LF (which should be expanded on transfer to a CR,LF on WINDOWS/DOS
  based systems). Due to the extended comments that can exist for
  each property, most lines will contain several thousand characters.
  It is not believed any line is longer than 10,000 characters, but 
  this is not a certainty. Not all fields are necessary, and a very
  few are are present in the availabiity file.

The first line contains labels for each field. Labels are four to 
  six characters in length, and may contain digits. The sequence
  may not match the sequence in this document.

Fireplace and parking fields are technially free-form, but LTA
has a coding scheme that reservationists use for these fields.
If these codes are needed, they will be provided separately.

Bedroom bed configuration. One 6-character string which will be null
for non-existing bedrooms. It will reflect up to 3 bed types, and the
number of each, in format "NTNTNT where N is number and T is Type.
The type codes are: K=king, Q=queen, D=double, S=single, B=bunk, H=
hideaway.  Thus, "1K2B" would signify 1 king, 2 bunk beds.

Bedroom location:
  Null-not defined or no such bedroom
  DOWN-downstairs
  UP-upstairs
  LOFT-loft

Bedroom TV:
  Null-not defined or no such bedroom
  NONE-No TV in bedroom
  B&W-Black & White
  COLOR-Color TV
  VCR-Has VCR on TV, color implied

Barbecue:
  CHAR-Charcoal
  COMM-Community
  ELEC-Electric
  GAS-Gas
  NONE-None

Parking:
  The parking field consists of one or two code, separated by a plus
  (+) sign when there are two codes.  Each code consists of a single
  digit, followed by one or two letters. The digit indicates the number
  of parking spaces provided with the property, the letter(s) indicate
  the type of parking, as follows:
    C=Carport
    D=Driveway
    G=Garage
    PP=Parking lot
    Anything else is undefined.
  Example: 2G+2D means two spaces in garage, two spaces in driveway.
